# 100 Days Of Code (iOS)
I've joined [the 100 Days Of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/): iOS App Development. [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode)

# Introduction
**The 100 Days Of Code Challenge** is a public challenge that participants have to code minimum an hour everyday in 100 days and tweet their progresses daily with the `#100DaysOfCode` hashtag.

To take the challenge, I selected **iOS App Development** which is quite different from my experience. I looked forward to learning new skills and even new mindset. It sounds quite interesting.
