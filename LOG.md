# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: 21 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started [the official SwiftUI tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui).

**Thoughts**: Very impressed with user friendly features of XCode.

## Day 1: 22 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: `View` components, Swift modifiers, how to bind data and state

**Thoughts**: View component statements look similar to other frontend frameworks like ReactJS. Closure looks like Lambda in Java or Python. EnvironmentObject sounds very new to me.

## Day 2: 23 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: How to draw shapes with `CGPoint` and customize animation effects.

**Thoughts**: Drawing with CGPoints seems like drawing SVG. The animation effect customization is powerful to fine tune given animations. The tutorial's hint to pin the main view while adjusting animations in sub-view is useful.

## Day 3: 24 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: `TabView`, `ScrollView`, `NavigationView`, `NavigationLink`, `EditButton`, `@Environment`

**Thoughts**: Modifier is a powerful tool in Swift. A developer should understand deeply SwiftUI components such as EditButton. They can perform specific functions themselves and developers do not need to implement the functions on top.

## Day 4: 25 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: Integration of SwiftUI and UIKit via `UIViewControllerRepresentable`

**Thoughts**: UIKit is a more mature framework in iOS and has been widely used for long. Pleased to know how to make SwiftUI and UIKit work together.

## Day 5: 26 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started [100 Days of SwiftUI in Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

**Thoughts**: I revised data types: Int, Double, String, Bool, Array, Dictionary and Set. They are similar to those in other languages such as Python. They are also improved, e.g. default in Dictionary, to help in common scenarios.

**Link to work**: N/A

## Day 6: 27 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: type annotation, if, switch, ternary, for, while, function and error

**Thoughts**: Although most features are similar to other languages, Swift has its unique syntax and handling.

**Link to work**: N/A

## Day 7: 28 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: function, closure and struct

**Thoughts**: Closure is one of powerful tools in Swift, similar to callback in JS or lambda in Python but has more features.

**Link to work**: N/A

## Day 8: 30 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: class, protocol and optional

**Thoughts**: Class and Optional exist in Java. Protocol is similar to Interface. A lot of syntax improve efficiency and readability.

**Link to work**: N/A

## Day 9: 31 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: Form, Section, TextField, Formatter, Picker, @ForcusState and two-way binding

**Thoughts**: Two-way binding is powerful. SwiftUI simplies UI development a lot.

## Day 10: 1 Jun 2022

**Today's Progress**: ZStack, Color, Image, Gradient structs and alert

**Thoughts**: LinearGradient, AngularGradient and RadialGradient make more colorful to the background. Various modifiers provide various functions, such as image shape and alert popup.

## Day 11: 2 Jun 2022

**Today's Progress**: Frame, Modifier Ordering, Conditional Modifier by Ternary, Environment Modifier vs Regular Modifier, Set View as Properties, View Composition, Custom Modifier and Custom Container.

**Thoughts**: There are various customisation from Modifier, View and Container. They allow developers to fine tune UI components in a modularised design.

## Day 12: 4 Jun 2022

**Today's Progress**: Building a Rock-Paper-Scissors app with skills learnt before.

**Thoughts**: It is straightforward to put components together, but it needs more detail or lesson learnt how to adjust each component like Text and Button to look more beautiful.
