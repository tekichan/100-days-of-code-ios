# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: 22 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: `View` components, Swift modifiers, how to bind data and state

**Thoughts**: View component statements look similar to other frontend frameworks like ReactJS. Closure looks like Lambda in Java or Python. EnvironmentObject sounds very new to me.

## Day 2: 23 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: How to draw shapes with `CGPoint` and customize animation effects.

**Thoughts**: Drawing with CGPoints seems like drawing SVG. The animation effect customization is powerful to fine tune given animations. The tutorial's hint to pin the main view while adjusting animations in sub-view is useful.

## Day 3: 24 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: `TabView`, `ScrollView`, `NavigationView`, `NavigationLink`, `EditButton`, `@Environment`

**Thoughts**: Modifier is a powerful tool in Swift. A developer should understand deeply SwiftUI components such as EditButton. They can perform specific functions themselves and developers do not need to implement the functions on top.

## Day 4: 25 May 2022

**Today's Progress**: Integration of SwiftUI and UIKit via `UIViewControllerRepresentable`

**Thoughts**: UIKit is a more mature framework in iOS and has been widely used for long. Pleased to know how to make SwiftUI and UIKit work together.
